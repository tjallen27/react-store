## React Shop
The aim of the project is to experiment with incorporating stripe payments into a react app.

### Tech Used:
* ReactJS
* Node.js
* Stripe API

I am going to render the Stripe form on the same page as the products rather than re-create the standard shopping cart layout, so the user experience of ordering / paying feels quicker as they never leave the product page.
